# Maximum Number of Removable Characters - LeetCode

## Description

You are given two strings `s` and `p` where `p` is a **subsequence** of `s`. You are also given a **distinct 0-indexed** integer array `removable` containing a subset of indices of `s` (`s` is also **0-indexed**).

You want to choose an integer `k` (`0 <= k <= removable.length`) such that, after removing `k` characters from `s` using the **first** `k` indices in `removable`, `p` is still a **subsequence** of `s`. More formally, you will mark the character at `s[removable[i]]` for each `0 <= i < k`, then remove all marked characters and check if `p` is still a subsequence.

Return _the **maximum**_ `k` _you can choose such that_ `p` _is still a **subsequence** of_ `s` _after the removals_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcacb", p = "ab", removable = [3,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1, "abcacb" becomes "accb".
"ab" is a subsequence of "accb".
If we remove the characters at indices 3, 1, and 0, "abcacb" becomes "ccb", and "ab" is no longer a subsequence.
Hence, the maximum k is 2.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcbddddd", p = "abcd", removable = [3,2,1,4,5,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: After removing the character at index 3, "abcbddddd" becomes "abcddddd".
"abcd" is a subsequence of "abcddddd".

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abcab", p = "abc", removable = [0,1,2,3,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: If you remove the first index in the array removable, "abc" is no longer a subsequence.

```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= p.length <= s.length <= 10^5`
-   `0 <= removable.length < s.length`
-   `0 <= removable[i] < s.length`
-   `p` is a **subsequence** of `s`.
-   `s` and `p` both consist of lowercase English letters.
-   The elements in `removable` are **distinct**.

## Solutions 

難處在於 checking subsequence。

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
    unordered_map<int, int> pos;
public:
    int maximumRemovals(string s, string p, vector<int>& removable) {
        
        for(int i = 0; i < removable.size(); i++) {
            pos[removable[i]] = i;
        }

        int l = 0, r = removable.size();
        while(l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if(valid(mid, s, p))
                l = mid + 1;
            else 
                r = mid;
        }

        return valid(l, s, p) ? l : l - 1;
    }

    bool valid(int k, string& s, string& p) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while(j < p.length()) {
            while(i < s.length() && s[i] != p[j])
                i++;
            if(i == s.length()) break;
            if(pos.find(i) == pos.end() || pos[i] >= k)
                j++;
            i++;
        }

        return j == p.length();
    }
};
```
