# Reachable Nodes With Restrictions - LeetCode

## Description

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>` in the tree. You are also given an integer array `restricted` which represents **restricted** nodes.

Return _the **maximum** number of nodes you can reach from node_ `0` _without visiting a restricted node._

Note that node `0` will **not** be a restricted node.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,1],[4,0],[0,5],[5,6]], restricted = [4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
We have that [0,1,2,3] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/15/ex2drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,5],[0,4],[3,2],[6,5]], restricted = [4,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
We have that [0,5,6] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.

```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
-   `edges.length == n - 1`
-   `edges[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < n`
-   `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
-   `edges` represents a valid tree.
-   `1 <= restricted.length < n`
-   `1 <= restricted[i] < n`
-   All the values of `restricted` are **unique**.

## Solutions 

- Key: treat `restricted` as `vistied`!
### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
    vector<vector<int>> adj;
    int res = 0;
public:
    int reachableNodes(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& restricted) {
        adj.resize(n);
        for(auto edge: edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        
        for(auto node: restricted) {
            visited[node] = true;
        }
        dfs(0, visited);

        return res;
    }

    void dfs(int i, vector<bool>& visited) {

        if(visited[i]) return;

        visited[i] = true;
        res = res + 1;

        for(auto j: adj[i]) {
            dfs(j, visited);
        }
    }
};
```
