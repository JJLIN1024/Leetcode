# Frog Jump - LeetCode

## Description

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of `stones`' positions (in units) in sorted **ascending order**, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be `1` unit.

If the frog's last jump was `k` units, its next jump must be either `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= stones.length <= 2000`
-   `0 <= stones[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
-   `stones[0] == 0`
-   `stones`Â is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

## Solutions 

Key: Without pruning will results in TLE. And there is no `unordered_set<pair<int, int>>` in C++!

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
    unordered_set<int> S;
    set<pair<int, int>> F;
    int target;
public:
    bool canCross(vector<int>& stones) {
        for(int i = 0; i < stones.size(); i++) {
            S.insert(stones[i]);
        }
        target = stones.back();
        return dfs(stones[0] + 1, 1);
    }

    bool dfs(int pos, int prevJump) {
        if(S.find(pos) == S.end()) return false;
        
        // pruning
        if(F.find({pos, prevJump}) != F.end()) return false;

        if(pos == target) return true;
        if(dfs(pos + prevJump + 1, prevJump + 1)) return true;
        if(prevJump > 0 && dfs(pos + prevJump, prevJump)) return true;
        if(prevJump - 1 > 0 && dfs(pos + prevJump - 1, prevJump - 1)) return true;
        
        F.insert({pos, prevJump});
        return false;
    }
};
```
