# Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups - LeetCode

## Description

You are given the `head` of a linked list.

The nodes in the linked list are **sequentially** assigned to **non-empty** groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (`1, 2, 3, 4, ...`). The **length** of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,

-   The `1<sup>st</sup>` node is assigned to the first group.
-   The `2<sup>nd</sup>` and the `3<sup>rd</sup>` nodes are assigned to the second group.
-   The `4<sup>th</sup>`, `5<sup>th</sup>`, and `6<sup>th</sup>` nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.

Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to `1 + the length of the second to last group`.

**Reverse** the nodes in each group with an **even** length, and return _the_ `head` _of the modified linked list_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/25/eg1.png)

```
Input: head = [5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,4]
Output: [5,6,2,3,9,1,4,8,3,7]
Explanation:
- The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
- The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/25/eg2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,1,0,6]
Output: [1,0,1,6]
Explanation:
- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
- The length of the last group is 1. No reversal occurs.

```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/17/ex3.png)

```
Input: head = [1,1,0,6,5]
Output: [1,0,1,5,6]
Explanation:
- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
- The length of the last group is 2. The nodes are reversed.

```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10<sup>5</sup>]`.
-   `0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>`

                head = nextHead;

        }

        return dummy->next;

    ListNode* reverse(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head) return head;
        ListNode* prev = NULL;
        while(head) {
            auto tmp = head->next;
            head->next = prev;
            prev = head;
            head = tmp;
        }
        return prev;
    }
